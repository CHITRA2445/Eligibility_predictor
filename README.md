# Marriage Eligibility_predictor
The marriage eligibility predictor takes four input features: name, age, country, and gender. Based on these inputs, the model performs a binary classification, determining whether an individual is eligible or not eligible for marriage.
I experimented with three different algorithms for this classification task:
Decision Tree: 86.27 % accuracy
Random Forest: 96.07% accuracy
AdaBoost:100 % accuracy
AdaBoost emerged as the best-performing algorithm, achieving 100% accuracy. So i used it for final implementation
